# The Great Northwest Baking Show
## A socially-distanced murder mystery based on a certain British baking show

> Welcome to the Great Northwest Baking Show!
> For the first time ever, the global baking competition phenomenon is going local with a season focusing on the amateur bakers of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.
> Everything was lined up to make this season a smash-hit. With a gorgeous shooting location of Lakewood, WA’s Thornewood Castle and a superstar judging lineup that included of Baking Show legend Paul Holyroot, this was going to be the best season of the Baking Show yet.
> At least, that was the plan. Alas, late on the night before the finale was to be shot, Paul Holyroot was discovered dead in his personal dressing room by one of his co-hosts. The blood splattered across the room left little room for doubt – this was a murder.
> The detectives have been called.
> The crime scene has been locked down.
> Now day is breaking and one thing has been made clear – no one is leaving here until the murderer has been found.

The Great Northwest Baking Show is a murdery mystery party designed to be played socially-distanced over video chat.  A murder has occurred at the filming location of the new season of the hit baking competition show, and the players are all suspects in that murder! Each player must prove their innocence must prove their innocence by exploring a digital crime scene, collecting clues, and building a case against the true killer. At the end of the game, the players will vote to determine who they believe the murderer to be -- if they catch the real killer, the killer is arrested and everyone who voted for them wins. If not, an innocent person is sent to jail, and the murderer wins instead

By customizing the included [Twine](http://twinery.org) project and uploading it somewhere on the web, you can run this unique mystery experience for your own friends.

### Details

* The Great Northwest Baking Show is designed for 6-8 players plus a moderator.
* The game takes around 3 hours to play in total.
* The game is run over group video chat. We used [Discord](http://discord.com), and this documentation will assume you are too, but it should convert cleanly to other popular video chat platforms (Zoom, etc.).
* You will need somewhere to upload your [Twine](http://twinery.org) project so that your players can explore your customized crime scene.
* The Great Northwest Baking Show is designed to be played by adults -- think a light R or 15 film rating. It features swearing, textual descriptions of dead bodies and blood, along with themes of substance abuse, infidelity, and suicidal ideation related to certain characters. Please ensure that all of your players are informed and comfortable with this content before playing this mystery. Improv and roleplaying games (such as murder mystery parties) can be very intense for players, and you don't want to spring potentially triggering content on people unawares.
* Much of the game's structure is based on the excellent Korean investigative game show [Crime Scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Scene_(South_Korean_TV_series)), which I highly recommend you check out if you're a fan of mystery games.

### The Rules

All of the players investigate the crime scene together, searching for clues, presenting the evidence that they discover, and running interrogations to try to poke holes in each other’s alibis.

The goal of the innocent suspects is to discover the killer’s true identity and successfully arrest them via a majority vote at the end of the game. If the murderer is arrested at the end of the game, all of the players who voted for the murderer win the game.

The goal of the murderer is to avoid suspicion and ultimately get an innocent suspect arrested instead. If someone other than the murderer is arrested at the end of the game, the murderer wins.

There is one key rule that is important to keep in mind: only the murderer is allowed to lie. 

While there is only one murderer, innocent suspects may also have personal secrets that they would prefer remain hidden. As such, although they are not allowed to lie, innocent suspects are allowed to be otherwise evasive by providing incomplete answers, misdirecting other players, or even refusing to answer questions point-blank.  It is worth noting that all of these tactics may make you more suspicious than if you had just answered the question directly, however.

If an innocent suspect does accidentally lie and realizes it after the fact, they must attempt to correct the lie as soon as possible, regardless of how suspicious it may appear to do so.

### The Structure

The game takes place over multiple phases, each representing a new step of the murder investigation.  Each of these phases is proctored by the **game master**. (If you're reading this, this probably means you!) The game master exists outside of the world of the story and should remain an unbiased observer over the events. As their only role is to facilitate the game and make sure that everyone has as much fun as possible, it is important that all the other players carefully follow any instructions that the game master gives. It is also important that the players do not lie to the game master.

If playing with more than six players, some players may be playing the Detective and the Detective’s Assistant. These players will join the suspects in investigating the crime scene and voting on who they believe the criminal to be.  However, they are not suspects themselves, and it is guaranteed that neither of them is the killer.

Here are the phases of the game, along with rough estimates of the time allotted for each phase:

* Initial introductions and presentation of alibis:  ~15 minutes
** If the Detective is playing, they may ask each player to introduce themselves and explain their alibi in turn. If no Detective is present or if they are not comfortable doing so, the game master lead the introductions instead.
* First round of crime scene investigation:  ~15 minutes
* Presentation of initial findings:  ~20 minutes
* Second round of crime scene investigation:  ~15 minutes
* Presentation of secondary findings:  ~20 minutes
* Final round of crime scene investigation:  ~25 minutes
** During this round, the Detective and the Detective’s Assistant are free to invite suspects into the Interrogation Room for a private discussion.
* Final deliberations and discussion:  ~15 minutes
* All players submit their votes for who they believe to be the killer:  ~5 minutes
* The killer is revealed and the winners are announced

### Setup

#### Invite your players

First thing's first -- who's going to play in your game? Remember that you need between 6 and 8 players to run a full game!

You'll want to reach out to each of your potential guests, tell them a bit about the game, and send them a link to a scheduling tool such as [WhenIsGood](https://whenisgood.net/) or [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/) to establish what times would work well for them.

You can use the [game pitch](https://github.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/blob/main/Templates/Template_1_Pitch.md) to make pitching the game easy as filling in a couple blanks and hitting send.

#### Set up your Discord server

You will need a video chat service to use during the game. We recommend using [Discord](http://discord.com), and have provided a [Discord template](https://discord.new/Eh3Tg4UNfx8z) that you can use to automatically configure a server to match the requirements of The Great Northwest Baking Show.

While the game can be played with all of the players in a single group call the whole time, it is preferable that you are able to split the players up so that they can discuss and conspire amongst each other secretly during the game. To do that, we recommend using a video chat service that allows players to separate into multiple groups and configruing the following group areas:

* A group chat area where everyone can meet to discuss things openly between investigations
* Three smaller 'team' areas where players can talk during investigations (3 players max)
* One area per suspect character that the player controlling that character can use to invite people to have private discussions (3 players max)
* One Interrogation Room that the Detective and Detective's Assistant can pull suspects into to interrogate them during the third investigation round (3 players max)

If you use the Discord template, all of these areas will be created for you automatically. It also has an `@gm` role configured that you can grant to yourself, which will enable you to enter any of the discussion areas, regardless of the current player count.


#### Send out character surveys

Once you have the requisite 6-8 players signed up and a date selected, you'll need to assign each player a character that will be a good fit for them. To make sure everyone gets a character that they will enjoy playing, you'll want to try and pick characters that optimize for each player's *interest* and their *comfort*.

We've built a simple a simple Google Forms survey that you can send to your players to determine how comfortable each player is with lying and what characters most appeal to them. To use this survey, go to [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GT6qnlQOnexu0W7sRmCC1E7tt3x0GwdCcl70ILAGmTg/copy) and hit `Make a copy` to create a duplicate copy that you can adjust and send out to your players.

This is also the point where you should tell the players more details about how the game is run and what kinds of content they should be prepared to expect. We recommend filling out [this template](https://github.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/blob/main/Templates/Template_2_PlayerSurveys.md) to make sure you include all of the key details.


#### Assign each player a character

Once each player has completed their surveys, it is time to assign everyone the characters that they will be playing. Again, it is important to do your best to assign each player a character that will maximize their *interest* and *comfort*. Always prioritize comfort first -- it's better to assign a player a character that they're not so excited about than one that they are excited about that will make them feel uncomfortable or unsafe!

To help you assign players the right characters, you can check this [list of character summaries](https://github.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/blob/main/Spoilers/CharacterBriefs.md), which includes information about how much lying is involved in playing each character and what potentially triggering content their player may be forced to closely engage with.

By comparing each player's survey answers to the list of characters, it should be relatively easy to assign everyone a character who will be a good match for their comfort and interest levels. Since the murderer is the most important and hardest role to play, we recommend assigning that first, and then fitting everyone else to the remaining role that is the best match.

Remember that the Detective is only available if you have 7 or more players, and the Detective's Assistant is only available with a full 8 players. If you have more than 8 players, you can assign multiple Detective's Assistants, but note that this is not intended and the game is likely to be slower, more chaotic, and potentially harder for the murderer to escape justice than is intended.

#### Send out player assignments

Once you have assigned each player their character, you will want to send them their character packet! The character packets contain everything that the player will need in order to play their character, including the full rules of the game, along with their character's backstory, alibis, and dark secrets.

You can get the link to each player's character packet from [this list](https://github.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/blob/main/Spoilers/CharacterPackets.md). You can send them the link to the original file or use it to make a copy that you control. Either should be fine, but if you wish to make any edits to the character packets, you will need to make your own copy.

Once you have a link to each player's character packet, you can send it to them using one of these templates:

* [Suspect player assignment template](https://github.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/blob/main/Templates/Template_3_PlayerPacks_Suspects.md)
* [Detective / Assistant player assignment template](https://github.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/blob/main/Templates/Template_4_PlayerPacks_Detectives.md)

#### Customize the Twine project

Before you can play, you must customize the Twine project so that your players can explore an immersive crime scene environment that reflects their character assignments. (In other words, you need to copy-paste everyone's names into the project so that it refers to everyone by the right name. 😃)

If you have not downloaded Twine before, you should install it from [Twinery.org](https://twinery.org/). Make sure you have version 2.3.9 or later -- previous versions have a bug with the Chapbook story format that will prevent the game from running correctly.

Next, download the Great Northwest Baking Show Twine project by right-clicking [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/main/Twine/The%20Great%20Northwest%20Baking%20Show.html), hitting Save As, and downloading it to your Twine stories directory (Documents/Twine/Stories on both PC and Mac).

![Selecting the Twine project](https://github.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/raw/main/Images/TwineProject.PNG)

Open Twine and select the Great Northwest Baking Show project.

![Opening the Welcome node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/main/Images/WelcomeNode.PNG)

Double-click the node labeled Welcome to open the script editor.

![Modifying the character names](https://github.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/raw/main/Images/PlayerNames.PNG)

The Welcome node contains all of the customizable game state. At a minimum, you should update each of the character names to match the players playing those characters.

If you wish, you can also update certain other elements, such as the name of The YouTuber's channel or the names of various non-player characters (NPCs). For instance, if an NPC shares a name with one of your players, you may wish to change the NPC's name to avoid potential confusion. Please note that these additional customizable elements are also referenced in the character packets, so you will want to also update the packets to reflect any changes that you make here. The player names are not referenced in the character packets, so you will not need to change the packets if all you change are the player names.

Feel free to press the Test or Play buttons at any time to verify that the game runs correctly with your changes.

![Publishing the Twine project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonagill/GreatNorthwestBakingShow/main/Images/PublishToFile.PNG)

When you have made all of the changes that you wish to make, you will need to publish the Twine project and upload it somewhere on the web. To publish the project, click on the large arrow next to the project title at the bottom of the screen, then select `Publish to File`. This will export the project as an HTML file that you can upload to any web server and share with your players on game day.
