# The Great Northwest Baking Show
## A socially-distanced murder mystery based on a certain British baking show

The Great Northwest Baking Show is a murdery mystery party designed to be played socially-distanced over video chat.  A murder has occurred at the filming location of the new season of the hit baking competition show, and the players are all suspects in that murder! Each player must prove their innocence must prove their innocence by exploring a digital crime scene, collecting clues, and building a case against the true killer. At the end of the game, the players will vote to determine who they believe the murderer to be -- if they catch the real killer, the killer is arrested and everyone who voted for them wins. If not, an innocent person is sent to jail, and the murderer wins instead

By customizing the included [Twine](http://twinery.org) project and uploading it somewhere on the web, you can run this unique mystery experience for your own friends.

**The Great Northwest Baking Show is designed for 6-8 players plus a moderator.**

Much of the game's structure is based on the excellent Korean investigative game show [Crime Scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Scene_(South_Korean_TV_series)), which I highly recommend you check out if you're a fan of mystery games.
