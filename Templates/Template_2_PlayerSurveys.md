Welcome to The Great Northwest Baking Show!
 
You've probably all heard already, but we are going to be playing in a custom Bake Off-themed murder mystery adventure on **[date]**!
 
**What is this?**   
 
If you haven't participated in a murder mystery party before, the premise is simple: everyone is assigned a character, and one of those characters is secretly a murderer. It will be up to you to search for clues, interrogate the other players, and ultimately decide on who you believe the true criminal to be, all while maintaining your alibi and defending yourself from suspicion. At the end of the game, everyone will vote for the player they most suspect, and whoever gets the most votes will be arrested and sent away for a long time.
 
If the murderer gets caught and arrested, all of the players who voted for them will win the game! However, if an innocent person is arrested instead, only the murderer will win!
 
**How will we play?** 
 
We will be meeting and playing the game using a custom Discord server.  If you haven't used Discord before, it's a free video chat app for PC. Just install the free Discord app on your PC, then open this link to join the server: **[Discord invite link]**
 
Please make sure you have a working microphone and webcam so that we can all see and hear each other. Watching your other players to see who is acting suspiciously will be a big part of the game!
 
You will also want to have easy access to a web browser, as you will need to access additional materials via the web throughout the game.
 
**When is this?**
 
The game will begin promptly at **[game time]** on **[date]**.  Please try to come half an hour early so we can all chit chat and get our how-do-you-dos out of the way before we get into character and kick off the investigation.
 
**How should I prepare?**  
 
Speaking of characters, all of the characters are pre-written and have specific character details that all fit together as part of the overarching story. This is NOT a role-playing game where you design your own character from scratch.
 
In order to make sure that you get assigned a character that you will enjoy playing, please fill out this survey by **[deadline]** at latest: **[Google survey link]**
 
Once I have received everyone's surveys, I will send everyone a custom information packet that contains both the rules of the game and the specific information about their character (including whether or not they are the murderer). Please take the time to read through your packet carefully and familiarize yourself with the details of your character. You may also wish to print out the packet or otherwise have it easily accessible so that you can reference it throughout the event.
 
Oh, and while it is not required, dressing up as your character is highly encouraged.
 
**Content warnings**
 
This is a murder mystery story, and thus will include themes of murder and death, including textual descriptions of dead bodies and blood.  There will be no detailed descriptions of wounds or gore. There will be no violent images or video.
 
However, there will also be additional themes of **substance abuse** and **infidelity**. These are not core elements of the story, but may inform details about certain characters. Please let me know if you have any concerns here and we will confidentially make arrangements as necessary to ensure your comfort.
 
 
Whew!  That's a lot of stuff.  Let me know if you have any questions!
