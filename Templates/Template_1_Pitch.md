# Initial pitch template
### Send this to prospective players to gauge their interest and encourage them to sign up

I’m going to be running a session of The Great Northwest Baking Show soon.  It’s a murder mystery game that's designed to be played over Discord.  If people are interested in playing sometime, I'd be happy to run it for this group.

It supports 6-8 players, and is themed after a certain well-known British baking show...

As part of the game, players will take on the role of suspects in a murder investigation.  Players will investigate each other's backstories and alibis while trying to avoid suspicion themselves.  One of you will be the murderer, and will need to lie to prevent yourself getting found out.
There will be textual descriptions of violent and other adult content, some of which your characters will be complicit in as part of their backstories.  I'll make sure to send out more details to people who express interest so that everyone can be informed about their own comfort.

If all that sounds good, please sign up here: **[link to Doodle or other scheduling tool]**. And if you have questions, please message me and I’ll do my best to answer them!
