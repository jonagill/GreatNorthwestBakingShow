Attached is a document containing the rules of the game and the background information for your character, including your schedule on the day of the murder.  Please take the time to read through this document at least an hour prior to game time at **[game time]**.  You don't have to memorize everything on it, but you should at least have a general familiarity about who your character is to inform your behavior and help construct your alibi during the investigation.  You may also want to print off the document and refer to it in greater detail throughout the investigation.

To help set the scene, is the full list of characters we will meet on **[game day]**:
