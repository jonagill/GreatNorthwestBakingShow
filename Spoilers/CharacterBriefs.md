## Non-Playable Characters

### Paul Holyroot

Paul Holyroot is the murder victim, and is not played by any player.

Paul Holyroot was a talented baker and world-renowned television host. He judged dozens of seasons of the globetrotting Baking Show franchise, and had become the face of the franchise with a reputation of being tough but fair critic. He had grown tired of the repetitive nature of filming season after season of the same show, however, and the nature of his work caused him to be away from home for months at a time and his home life deteriorated as a result.

Paul started to distance himself from his work in the months before his death, preferring to focus on his newfound passion: professional auto racing. While he could still turn on the charm when the cameras where rolling, behind the scenes he was short-tempered and often took his frustrations out on the crew. Whenever possible, he would retreat to his dressing room to play racing simulation games on PC and dream about being back on the track.

Paul hit his breaking point the night before they were to film the finale of the Great Northwest Baking Show. All he wanted to do was relax with his games, but people kept barging into his dressing room to make demands on his time and money. Was that all anyone ever wanted from him? At first he was angry, but eventually, Paul just felt tired. He resolved to make a clean break, to quit as soon as the finale was shot, and to spend his energy following his true passions.

Unfortunately for Paul, he would be dead by morning.

### The Comedian
#### Lying: 2/3 
#### Content warnings: Suicidal ideation, substance abuse

The Comedian is the host of the Great Northwest Baking Show. They have a problem with drinking and drugs. Two years ago they had to go to rehab after assaulting a heckler in a bar, ant they took the hosting job to help rehabilitate their image.

They have been passing the time between shoots by playing cards against Paul Holyroot, but a series of successively higher bets have left them in dire financial straits. Last night they lost more than they could afford on a single massive bet, and they considered taking their own life using the gun that they keep hidden in their dressing room. They lost their nerve at the last minute, though, and drank themselves into a stupor instead.

### The Creative Contestant 
#### Lying: 1/3 
#### Content warnings: Alcohol abuse

The Creative Contestant is one of the finalists in the Great Northwest Baking Show. As their name suggests, they like to show off with creative, expressive bakes. For example, the showstopper that they had planned for the finale was a scale model of the Seattle Space Needle built entirely out of cake.

However, baking is not their true passion. Instead, the Creative Contestant hoping to launch a new career as a murder mystery novelist, and they are hoping that the Baking Show will boost their profile enough to make their debut book a big success.

Yesterday they found evidence suggesting that the Technical Contestant had been sleeping with Paul Holyroot. Assuming this meant that the judging would be biased, they gave up on practicing for the evening and decided to vent their sorrows to the Youtuber instead.


### The Partygoer
#### Lying: 2/3 
#### Content warnings: Drug abuse

The Partygoer is Paul Holyroot's somewhat estranged adult step-child. They live in the UK, where they enjoy the high life on their father's dime, going to all kinds of high-class events and parties. They met the Director of Photography in a chance encounter at the Cannes film festival, and the two of them struck up a long-distance relationship.

The Partygoer arrived in the US yesterday to visit the Director of Photography and to ask their father to give them more money. However, Paul denied their request, accusing them and their mother of just using him for his fortune. Distraught, the Partygoer spent the evening trying to relax with a recreational dose of ketamine and a very long bath.


### The Director of Photography
#### Lying: 3/3 
#### Content warnings: None

The Director of Photography is an ambitious young filmmaker trying to make it big as a Hollywood auteur. Being an aspiring director doesn't pay the rent, though, and they had to start looking for paying work. With the Partygoer's help, they were able to convince Paul Holyroot to put in a good word and land them the DP job on the Great Northwest Baking Show.

It turns out that would be the last good thing Paul Holyroot would do for the Director of Photography. On set, Paul began to make the Director's life hell at every opportunity, calling them names, belittling them in front of the crew, and demanding that the Director wait on him hand-and-foot. When Paul declared his intent to cut the Partygoer out of his will, he threatened the Director's future with the Partygoer, and worse, the Partygoer's promise to use Paul's money to help fund the Director's debut film. With this, Director of Photography knew that they had to take matters into their own hands.

The Director of Photography is the murderer, and will therefore have to lie more than any other player. Make sure you assign this role to someone with a good poker face!


### The Technical Contestant
#### Lying: 2/3 
#### Content warnings: Adultery

The Technical Contestant is one of the finalists in the Great Northwest Baking Show. They like to use their engineering background to create complex and unique bakes beyond the capabilities of other bakers. However, their technical ability is the only reason they have got so far into the competition.

Early in the competition, the Technical Contestant struck up an affair with Paul Holyroot, causing Paul to judge their bakes more generously than other contestants' in future episodes. However, this was only a helpful side benefit, for the Technical Contestant's true goal was more sinister yet: blackmail.

Some years earlier, the Technical Contestant had invented the BakeBuddy, a specialized kitchen appliance designed to help amateur bakers create bakes far beyond their abilities. While the device was technically impressive, the Technical Contestant needed funding in order to produce and market it to a mass audience. They decided to pitch the BakeBuddy on the reality show *Kitchen Cabinet*, but one judge remained unconvinced, and they went home with no money.

That judge was Paul Holyroot.

The Technical Contestant hoped that by threatening Paul with photographic evidence of their affair, they would be able to convince him to pay them the money he denied them on *Kitchen Cabinet*. However, they were surprised to find that Paul took almost no convincing. Instead of getting angry, Paul just seemed resigned and defeated, and he wrote them a check without any argument.


### The YouTuber
#### Lying: 2/3
#### Content warnings: Alcohol abuse

The YouTuber is the second half of the the Great Northwest Baking Show's judging team. They are a massive fan of Paul Holyroot, and even operate a private fan blog about him. Getting to judge alongside Paul was a dream come true, so much so that they threw themselves completely into their judging work and stopped posting videos on the YouTube channel that made them famous, much to their agent's chagrin.

With their channel quiet and rapidly fading in popularity, the YouTuber desperately needed the Great Northwest Baking Show to become a big hit and get renewed. However, without Paul agreeing to judge again, there would be no chance of a second season, and for some reason he hadn't signed his paperwork yet.

When the YouTuber approached Paul to ask why he hadn't signed on yet, he turned on them, calling them names and declaring his intention to quit TV altogether. The YouTuber was distraught and ran away to vent their emotions onto their blog before angrily binge drinking the night away with the Creative Contestant.
